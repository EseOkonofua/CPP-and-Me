    CONSOLE APPLICATION : SpaceStationGreedyPartition Project Overview
========================================================================
The Greedy Project-Partition assignments purpose is to be able to read a file that shows project start times and end times.
We are supposed to find an optimal set that minimizes the amount of projects picked whilst having a project being active 
at all times between a set interval.

After finding the optimal set of projects we are supposed to partition the projects with as close as possible weights 
into 2 seperate vectors.
